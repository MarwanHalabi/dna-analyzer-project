# DNA - Intro
DNA sequences are composed of four types of nucleotides; 
The nucleotides are marked A (Adenine), G (Guanine), C (Cytosine) and T (Thymine).
A full DNA molecule usually consists of two strands, connected to each other in base-pair connections: As with Ts, and Cs with Gs. 
Three successive nucleotides generate a codon, which might be chemically "read" in various ways.
A full DNA sequence might be very long - for example, the full human genome holds ~3*109 nucleotides. However, lots of work can be done with relatively short sequences that represent a specific region within the DNA.
